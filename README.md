# minidotfiles

Dotfiles for user accounts that are not mine, such as single purpouse ones
in remote systems or lite versions for cases like Termux.

- `shellrcsnippets/` - append to shellrc as needed, the files shouldn't change
  much
- `submodules/` - git submodules that may be symlinked to, but pulling them
  in is up to the user.
